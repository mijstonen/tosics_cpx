This file is not used as a resource. 
Its intend is to force and trigger a rebuild, by
touch touch_me.txt (or with directory navigation path in front when called
from another directory). This will modify the date of this file which 
affects a ls -l of the containing directory. This will modify the hash, 
and so trigger a new build.
