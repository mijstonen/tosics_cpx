In this directory (re)sources are linked that indicate external dependencies.

The repositories keeping originals (and up to date) are located in
~/PUBLIC/ . The (linked) locations here are the installed - and
eventually modified - versions.

pstream.h
   Allows popen functionallity allong with the return value from the child process.
   See (local) /home/michel/PUBLIC/arch/pstreams-1.0.1
   See http://pstreams.sourceforge.net/
   Notice that there is also a Boost.Process library but could implicate a large
   boost dependency. pstream is (more then) sufficient.

TinySHA1.hpp
   Minimal code for sha calculations. Used for detecting uniqueness of
   kinds data (aka sourcecode).
