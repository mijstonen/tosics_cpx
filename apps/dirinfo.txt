In this folder, baby applications that started as a test or a script (aka in ../test)
grew out to a small application. Priliminary in the sense of using it within cpx it self
to enhance it.

They differ fromn scripts in that their binary form is stored for reuse in ..Kdevelop/build/cpx_apps/  .
The process should be as follows.

1. Inception in...cpx/test
    cpx appname.cpp testargs....

2. State change to ...cpx/app
    //depricated: cpx -o appname appname.cpp
    CPX-build-app appname

3. Use
    in a directory that is in the path:
        ln -s ...Kdevelop/build/cpx_apps/appname   (to the diretory containing the app)
    Incubate, maintain and use it.

4. Seniority and growing complexity.
    Appname is going become a full blown application. With multiple sources and
    library bindings.
    Leave the app directory.
    Cpx is not, and not meant to be, a full application developmnent environment,
    there are better environments for large scale complex (C++) application development.
    Take for example QTCreator, Eclipse or Visual studio.
