____________________________________________________________ "Such a lousy thing to to"

Research what 2 characters to choose when creating a base64 coding constructed filename.

Besides 0-9,a-z,A-Z we require 2 more characters that do not conflict when used as filename.
These are
    _
    .

Really, any other punctuation is used such way, 
that use of it in variable values can cause problems in scripts.

NB  . is also used to source a script, but that seems not conflicting.
NB  Use  $  i.s.o.  .   for C variable names  (side use, nothing implemented).
