Analyses and design of a better coded cpx
-----------------------------------------

Introduction

cpx.1 has been developped empirically and is more procedural and script alike, rather then bein object oriented.
This was also on purpose as the new tendency in the C++ community is to move away from the depending class
hierarchies and favour generics over object orientation.

However it has grown to a size that it becomes hard to read and maintain. And this document will provide analyzes
and design for readability, extendebility and maintainability of cpx.


Objectives

+ Improve cpx by splitting functionallity.
+ Make class data and class member functions i.s.o. lambda's as nested functions.
+ Generalize functionallity into the tosix::util library.
+ Strive to provide all functionallity in cpx being usable from cpx scripts (aka by migrating that
  functionality from cpx to tosix::util)


Extension directions
----------------------
A build system written in C++, so no other syntax and command effects need to be studied.
Option to start cpx script in a debugger with some preset breakpoints.
Integration of conducers.

TODO & DONE
>    starting with moving tinySha1.h and pstream.h to tosix::util:stdinc.hpp.   XXX
