The Micro preprocessor
----------------------
Needed for #! anyway
Makes easy shortcuts for complexer configurable included sources.
It ONLY works in the intended cpx script, not in other involved sources also compiled or included files.
The preprocessor command tags ALL and ONLY have
  1.  A # on the FIRST COLUMN of the line (# on other columsn will be ignored)
  2.  A command selector character that determinis the action to take. Use of punctuation characters is prefered.
      And some characters can not be used (easily) because of the cpp preprocessor key words (aka: d of #define,
      i of #if and #include).

The implementation is in cpx/runner2.cpp:runner() .


tag     usage
--      -----
#!      Only on the first line: Hash bang    #!/usr/bin/env cpx   makes the C++ program run like a script (aka, so
named; cpx-scripts)
        See also Meta programming
#|      #include "cpx-file-begin.hpp"   incorporating standard includes for cpx scripts

#(      Starts body of cpx::cpx_main()  (inc..cpx-all-before-script.hpp)
#)      Ends   body of cpx::cpx_main()  (inc..cpx-all-after-script.hpp)

#{      Starts main  (include cpx-main-definition-signature.hpp), prefere use of #(  and  #)
#}      Ends main (inc.. cpx-main-and-file-end.hpp), prefere use of #(  and  #)
#[      Starts main exception block (inc.. cpx-main-outer-try.hpp), prefere use of #(  and  #)
#]      Ends main exception block (inc..cpx-main-outer-catch-block.hpp), prefere use of #(  and  #)
#+ <name>   include a named cpx include  aka:  #+ myowninc.h   -> #include "cpx-myowninc.h"

#^<rest of line>
        Includes a file without involving it in the "modified" check,
        use it for includes (in /usr/include) that never/infrequently change.
        1. Directory WORK_DIR contains a specific include file called SOURCE_FILE.unchanged.hpp
        2. The include directives are written in that file.
        3. SOURCE_FILE.usr_include.hpp is NOT involved during the preprocessing for the hash.
        4. SOURCE_FILE.usr_include.hpp is included after inclusion of stdinc.hpp
            either by -include commandline
        #^ tags shall be put BEFORE #| may not and do not depend on tosics_util and have no predefed namespaces,
           after #| they do - as if they where in the current script and part of the project. However this
           would be unintended use of #^. Better use #include in the script to explicitly intend that the file
           is part of the (script) project.
        #^ does NOT interprete <rest of line> but copy all characters of that line to SOURCE_FILE.unchanged.hpp

    EXAMPLE
#^<boost/circular_buffer.hpp>  places "#include <boost/circular_buffer.hpp>" in SOURCE_FILE.unchanged.hpp


Meta programming
#!!      Not on the first line: Execute child program. This can be even a cpx script, but that is a special case.
            plain execution (depricated, puts to much responsibility in called executable)

................................................
Update of meta programming commands
#!? querying meta command, every call might produce different results despite equal arguments, alayas execute
#!= pure execution if previously arguments and generated output file differ

................................................

#!&      [reserved]Asynchronely execute child program
#!,      [reserved]Wait for all child programs to complete

Executing programs output is a single line in the source to be interpreted by the cpx parent program.
Most likely, the output is another include or micro preprocessor line. The child executable is
responsable for creating the output line. Executing child programs should be highly independed from each
other so they may executed in random order and asynchronely. However, their independence is not
enforced (priliminary because use of asyncrhone processing does not contribute signifficant
functionallity and implementation is defered till their is signifficant demand. Its only said that
child processes should take it into account).

Besides the name of the child process, also arguments can be given, similar as a commandline.
#! childprocess a b c

A special case of child program execution is when it's main process is cpx it self.
If cpx does writes to a single file or object (aka CPX-runner.log) what to do when
cpx programs run concurrently? And what to do when the parent cpx already uses these resources ?.
Logging is a special case, because we want to predict which log to monitor and collect all logs.
Differntiating with PID of the running cpx is technically a solution but with undesired side effects.


Planned
=======
Smart library binding allows to specify in the libraries
#$ {pkg-config_library>)0+


Prerequisites: You MUST export PKG_CONFIG_PATH wich is a (:/;) separated list of directories
                where *.pc files can be found. The libray names are specified as with pkg-config.
                if pkg-config ..... <pkg-config_library> succeeds, so has cpx to succeed.
example:

#$ Qt5Core

#^ <QFileSystemWatcher>






Solution
========
The toplevel cpx process will log to the main log file (aka:CPX-runner.log). It will also export environment variable
CPX_STACKLEVELCOUNT to the environment. The nested cpx executions, check and increase CPX_STACKLEVELCOUNT. They append
its value to the logfile name and so will append log messages to another logfile. However, all logs of multiple cpx
scripts are still collected in the same logfile.

Notice: The presumtion is made that in this case executed nested cpx scripts are tested independedly before, so that
compilation error representation was as with a single cpx file. This reduces the representation demands on nested cpx
execution, altough it has to be present. It should be the common case that the nested cpx scripts run without producing
(compile) errors.

Notice: that when executing scripts concurrently, aka: with #!& ,this will not work anymore, then we need the script
identification, aka: WORK_INPUT it self, but then logs cannot be collected and another log information presentation
mechnism will be required.

Notice: Nested cpx script executions, should never use the same script source, because with several dirived files the
cpx processes could get in conflict. Possibly it can be avoided when using CPX_STACKLEVELCOUNT in other filenames too.
