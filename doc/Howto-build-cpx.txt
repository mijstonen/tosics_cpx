How to build
------------

Note that the util library needs to be build first, in similar way as described
here for cpx.

Generate ninja build system from CMakeLists.txt in the ../cpx source directory.
To do that, run cmake-gui.

Where is the source code: /home/michel/Projects/Kdevelop/cpx
Where to build the binaries: /home/michel/Projects/Kdevelop/build/cpx

Changes to cmake settings  (CMakeCache.txt)
These are importand because cpx apps are build in Debug mode.

util
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug
  CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON

cpx


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Importand: do NOT manually backup or save files within the build tree and its
project subdirectories. To reset the build system, it is allowed to enirely delete
these directories, so any manual modifications will be lost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

press Generate

from a console in ../../build/cpx  run ninja

aka

    ninja -v clean
    ninja -v all



BUGS
----
At this moment, cpx and util need to be compiled with gcc (actuall gcc version is 6.2.0 20161005)
Use update-alternatives --query c++ to figure out the setting and veryfy that g++ is used as c++).
There are some unresolved issues with clang that prevent building cpx out of the
box, possibly orinate in the util library.
There are some manual - but commented ) swithches (aka #if 0  or #if 1 ) in util, but it will limit
the functionallity somewhat.


Testing
-------
in /home/michel/Projects/Kdevelop/cpx/test/

Among others you find test scripts with a cpp extension. Notice that many of them have the executable bit set.
If current directory is prepended to the path (alias cupas on my own system, will do that and shows all directories in
the path after that), you can enter these executable scripts direct on the commandline.
